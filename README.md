# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges implemented in TypeScript using Deno.

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed on your machine

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
deno run --allow-read AOC_2024/DAY_1/main.ts
```

## Running Tests

To run tests for a specific day:

```bash
deno test AOC_2024/DAY_1/main_test.ts
```

### Development

1. Each day's solution is in its own directory under `AOC_2024/`
2. Input files should be placed in the corresponding day's directory
3. Tests are written using Deno's built-in testing framework
